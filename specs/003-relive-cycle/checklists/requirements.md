# Specification Quality Checklist: Relive Cycle

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Three clarifications resolved on 2026-09-27 (see the spec's Clarifications section): keep Scenarios and
  reuse their parts (FR-048); runs affect only their own attributable traffic, with the user choosing per
  step before the run how unattributable matching calls are handled, Block by default (FR-049, FR-049a/b);
  unlimited isolated concurrent runs (FR-050, FR-050a).
- Mentions of ALFRED's own concepts (session cycles, proxies, rules, call picker, difference view) name
  existing product capabilities the feature must reuse, not implementation choices.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
